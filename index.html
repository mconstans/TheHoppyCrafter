        <div class="section_process_body">For many beer enthusiasts and homebrewers, the idea to turn their passion into a profession has crept up while sipping a finely made brew. 
          Homebrewing can be dangerous if done incorrectly and many individuals wanting to get started with homebrewing are intimidated by principles of fermentation or the best hygiene practices for crafting your favorite elixir. New brewers struggle with:
          <ul>
          <li>Lack of resources available to teach new brewers from home</li>
          <li>Information is often presented in a scientific manner</li>
          <li>Brewing instruction geared towards individuals with college-level education</li>
          <li>Lack access to brew shops with expert knowledge & hands-on learning opportunities</li>
          </ul>

        </div>
        <div id="description" class="section_header">The Goal</div>          
        This project centers around creating a platform that brings trust and education to the users fingertips. It empowers and provides support to homebrewers embarking on their new hobby. Hoppy Crafter's goal is to bring science into the home in an easy to understand way. No more having to purchase expensive homebrew books that are overly techincal and densely written in a way the average user struggles to understand. With this platform, homebrewers will have the ability to access several in depth courses, numerous recipes, calculators and even connect with other instructors and other homebrewers.

Through the use of thoughtful illustrations, motion graphics and good user experience planning, I created a straightforward design that could break down a complex topic into digestable bits. <br> </div>

        <div class="process_body_copy">The overall user experience and interface was the <strong>backbone</strong> of this project. My ultimate goal for this project was all about crafting for an experience for mobile users kept using progressing through the course. Users have come to expect specificdesign patternswhen using their phones, even if they aren't aware of it. Navigation menus are in the top left, user profiles in the top right, swiping left or right to progress are all habits that have been ingrained in us through experience and repitition. Keeping this tactical memory in mind when designing The Hoppy Crafter app was key while maintaining my own sense of visual identity. Much time was spent on low fidelity layouts and testing before advancing to the high fidelity mockups.</div>

        <div class="process_body_copy">The initial prototype I created using Adobe XD can be seen below. While it was functional, it wasn't quite meeting the goals I had set for this project initially. It lacked a fun environment and had too much bodycopy that made for a harder learning experience.</div>

        <div class="process_body_copy"><strong>The second half</strong> was developing the brand, illustrations and motion pieces to aid users in the learning experience. Next I began working on my logos for the app. I spent some time sketching various text versus ornamental logos and digitized my favorites. For the logo I used a circlular shape to represent a bottle cap used in the beer making process. Logos were redesigned with a two-toned approach or had textured applied to help with visibility.</div>

         <div class="process_body_copy">I composed a brand style packet to guide design choices for the target audience. It included standardizing font sizes for readability and sans serif types for clarity, color usage to engage the user.</div>

         <div class="process_body_copy">The earthy colors I chose represent many of the colors found in beer brewing from lime green of hops to the orange hews in the malts and grains used. I paired these with other bright colors to create a bright and engaging atmosphere for the users as well a deep blue to bring in a touch of seriousness to the learning experience. Using colors in a more thoughtful manner not only provides more meaningful intentions but also improves clarity and helps all users better process information. The color choices are important for readability and clarity of the information in the app so this is something that needed to be addressed first. I broke the colors into primary, secondary, neutral colors and colors to be used in a supplementary manner. </div>

            <div class="section_research_body"> My approach to help users understand the complexities of homebrewing was through fun and engaging illustrations and animations. Procreate was used for the majority of the illustrations which were done first by sketching out my design and applying watercolor brushes to achieve a softer look.

          <h3>Infographic</h3>
          <p>The Hoppy Crafter project was designed from the start to help teach and keep users interested in homebrewing. In my motion design course, I used Adobe After Effects to create an early infographic about the brewing process to educate users. While not updated to have my current brand style guidelines, this still serves as a good exemplar of the look and feel of the videos I hope to incorporate into the course itself. </p>
          <p>Another fun piece I had the opportunity to work on was a promotional video for the app. I created a 3D rendering of a bottle cap within Cinema 4D, a three-dimensional modeling software, featuring my brand logo. Within Cinema 4D, I was able to simulate flipping of a bottle cap before transferring the rest of the project to After Effects to continue editing. I created this piece to help advertise the app in the future within local brew shops and on social media.</p>
