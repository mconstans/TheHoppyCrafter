        <div class="section_process_body">For many beer enthusiasts and homebrewers, the idea to turn their passion into a profession has crept up while sipping a finely made brew. 
          Homebrewing can be dangerous if done incorrectly and many individuals wanting to get started with homebrewing are intimidated by principles of fermentation or the best hygiene practices for crafting your favorite elixir. New brewers struggle with:
          <ul>
          <li>Lack of resources available to teach new brewers from home</li>
          <li>Information is often presented in a scientific manner</li>
          <li>Brewing instruction geared towards individuals with college-level education</li>
          <li>Lack access to brew shops with expert knowledge & hands-on learning opportunities</li>
          </ul>
          <br>This project centers around creating a platform that brings trust and education to the users fingertips. It empowers and provides support to homebrewers embarking on their new hobby. Hoppy Crafter's goal is to science into the home in an easy to understand way. No more having to purchase expensive homebrew books that are overly techincal and densely written in a way the average user struggles to understand. With this platform, homebrewers will have the ability to access several in depth courses, numerous recipes, calculators and even connect with other instructors and other homebrewers.

      <div class="section_research_body"> The Hoppy Crafter is a personal project where I created a mobile app that would teach users the art of homebrewing no matter their education level. Through the use of thoughtful illustrations, motion graphics and good user experience planning, I created a straightforward design that could break down a complex topic into digestable bits. <br> </div>

        <div class="process_body_copy">The overall user experience and interface was the <strong>backbone</strong> of this project. My ultimate goal for this project was all about crafting for an experience for mobile users kept using progressing through the course. Users have come to expect specificdesign patternswhen using their phones, even if they aren't aware of it. Navigation menus are in the top left, user profiles in the top right, swiping left or right to progress are all habits that have been ingrained in us through experience and repitition. Keeping this tactical memory in mind when designing The Hoppy Crafter app was key while maintaining my own sense of visual identity. Much time was spent on low fidelity layouts and testing before advancing to the high fidelity mockups.</div>
