        <div class="section_process_body">For many beer enthusiasts and homebrewers, the idea to turn their passion into a profession has crept up while sipping a finely made brew. 
          Homebrewing can be dangerous if done incorrectly and many individuals wanting to get started with homebrewing are intimidated by principles of fermentation or the best hygiene practices for crafting your favorite elixir. New brewers struggle with:
          <ul>
          <li>Lack of resources available to teach new brewers from home</li>
          <li>Information is often presented in a scientific manner</li>
          <li>Brewing instruction geared towards individuals with college-level education</li>
          <li>Lack access to brew shops with expert knowledge & hands-on learning opportunities</li>
          </ul>

        </div>
        <div id="description" class="section_header">The Goal</div>          
        This project centers around creating a platform that brings trust and education to the users fingertips. It empowers and provides support to homebrewers embarking on their new hobby. Hoppy Crafter's goal is to bring science into the home in an easy to understand way. No more having to purchase expensive homebrew books that are overly techincal and densely written in a way the average user struggles to understand. With this platform, homebrewers will have the ability to access several in depth courses, numerous recipes, calculators and even connect with other instructors and other homebrewers.

      <div class="section_research_body"> The Hoppy Crafter is a personal project where I created a mobile app that would teach users the art of homebrewing no matter their education level. Through the use of thoughtful illustrations, motion graphics and good user experience planning, I created a straightforward design that could break down a complex topic into digestable bits. <br> </div>

        <div class="process_body_copy">The overall user experience and interface was the <strong>backbone</strong> of this project. My ultimate goal for this project was all about crafting for an experience for mobile users kept using progressing through the course. Users have come to expect specificdesign patternswhen using their phones, even if they aren't aware of it. Navigation menus are in the top left, user profiles in the top right, swiping left or right to progress are all habits that have been ingrained in us through experience and repitition. Keeping this tactical memory in mind when designing The Hoppy Crafter app was key while maintaining my own sense of visual identity. Much time was spent on low fidelity layouts and testing before advancing to the high fidelity mockups.</div>

        <div class="process_body_copy">The initial prototype I created using Adobe XD can be seen below. While it was functional, it wasn't quite meeting the goals I had set for this project initially. It lacked a fun environment and had too much bodycopy that made for a harder learning experience.</div>
        <a href="#" class="lightbox-link w-inline-block w-lightbox"><img src="images/wireframe2.png" alt="" class="image-4"></a>
        <div class="process_body_copy"><strong>The second half</strong> was developing the brand, illustrations and motion pieces to aid users in the learning experience. Next I began working on my logos for the app. I spent some time sketching various text versus ornamental logos and digitized my favorites. For the logo I used a circlular shape to represent a bottle cap used in the beer making process. Logos were redesigned with a two-toned approach or had textured applied to help with visibility.</div>
         <img src="images/Slide5.png" alt="" class="image-4">
         <div class="process_body_copy">I composed a brand style packet to guide design choices for the target audience. It included standardizing font sizes for readability and sans serif types for clarity, color usage to engage the user.</div>
         <img src="images/CapstonePresentation.png" alt="" class="image-4"> 
         <div class="process_body_copy">The earthy colors I chose represent many of the colors found in beer brewing from lime green of hops to the orange hews in the malts and grains used. I paired these with other bright colors to create a bright and engaging atmosphere for the users as well a deep blue to bring in a touch of seriousness to the learning experience. Using colors in a more thoughtful manner not only provides more meaningful intentions but also improves clarity and helps all users better process information. The color choices are important for readability and clarity of the information in the app so this is something that needed to be addressed first. I broke the colors into primary, secondary, neutral colors and colors to be used in a supplementary manner. </div>

        <div class="section_header">Illustrations</div>
            <div class="section_research_body"> My approach to help users understand the complexities of homebrewing was through fun and engaging illustrations and animations. Procreate was used for the majority of the illustrations which were done first by sketching out my design and applying watercolor brushes to achieve a softer look. I wanted to demonstrate my ability to bring my background in illustration together with both my academic and professional experiences to show those disciplines while aiding the user in learning</div> <br>

          <p>Sensability is a project initially designed for Deaf audiences to visualize and feel music. I started this project in Experimental Interaction, a course as a part of the Master of Arts in Graphic and Web Design curriculum. The idea for my project was to explore different music sources with the movement of the amplitude which incorporates a dimensional visualization.</p>
          <p>In Cinema 4D, a three-dimensional modeling software, different sections of the sphere objects are synced to selected areas of the music's amplitude and react by upward and downward movement.</p>

I would also like to feature craft recipes to make the process of brewing easy to learn and follow along until users master the art of brewing.
